# Summary

The phone number field validation appears incorrect.  
The field accepts up to 16 characters including letters and special characters, and the user can still proceed to the next step with an invalid phone number.

---

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the Guest Explore Memberships page.
2. Start the membership signup flow.
3. Enter an invalid phone number (letters or symbols).
4. Continue to the next step.

---

# Actual Result

The form allows the user to proceed even with an invalid phone number.

---

# Expected Result

The system should restrict the phone field to a valid numeric phone format and prevent proceeding until a valid number is entered.

---

# Potential Impact

Users may be able to complete the membership purchase without a valid contact phone number.

This may lead to:

- missing customer contact information
- support issues
- incomplete user profiles

---

# Testing Notes

Payment step was not verified initially due to lack of a test card.

# Conclusion

Validation behavior appears **inconsistent across different flows**:

| Flow | Validation |
|-----|-----|
Guest Widget | Works correctly |
Profile Editing | Validation bypass possible |
New Account (Safari) | Validation bypass possible |

This suggests that **backend validation may not be consistently enforced** and some flows rely only on frontend validation.
